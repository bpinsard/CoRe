Please find attached the manuscript "Consolidation alters motor sequence-specific distributed representations." by Pinsard, Boutin, Gabitov, Lungu, Benali and Doyon, for consideration as a research article in Elife neuroscience category.

This article investigates the reorganization of networks supporting the expression of newly acquired motor sequential skills after their consolidation using novel multivariate measures between fMRI BOLD activity patterns.

Research in neuroimaging, including work from our lab, has largely described evolution of brain regions activity levels during motor sequence learning (MSL).
Notably a reorganization in networks comprising cortical, cerebellar, hippocampal and striatal regions is observed when initial practice and retest sessions are separated by a sleep period during which reactivations of a subset of these regions occurs.
These changes show that complementary processes contributing to a more efficient practice are differentially at play in the course of learning.
However, as these results rely on regional fMRI BOLD activity level, they do not necessarily reflect that this network as a whole encode the motor sequential knowledge.
Multivariate statistical analyses have since allowed to infer the tuning of local neuronal circuit to sequential features by characterizing differences in fine-grained activity patterns of BOLD activity.
However, such analyses have been conducted mainly at the cortical level and compared representations of motor sequences intensively trained over multiple days to newly practiced ones.
Besides, the approach was often based on classifier cross-validated accuracy with parametric statistical testing, a combination that was shown to suffer from bias.
Yet, more adapted multivariate measures have since been developed.
Hence, it is of interest to assess the encoding of motor sequential information at an initial and critical stage of learning, using a statistically robust and sensitive method.
It is also crucial to specifically assess, in humans, whether striatal representations of motor sequential skill emerge and progressively shift during learning and stabilization of the memory, in analogy to recent results obtained by invasive neuronal measures in animals.

We herein aimed to investigate representational changes at a more focused and earlier stage of MSL that is the offline consolidation process following regular practice.
By measuring fine-grained activity evoked by the practice of two explicitly trained sequences of finger movements, which underwent consolidation as well as two similar newly acquired sequences, we were able to compute the unbiased continuous multivariate distance between these patterns over the whole brain with a searchlight technique.
We then assessed the prevalence of significant multivariate distances and their differences between learning stages across participants using non-parametric permutation testing.
We here uncovered that large cortical regions representing new and consolidated sequences overlap but a significant consolidation-induced reorganization of cortico-subcortical networks occurs.
Indeed, the processing of the sequences in dorsomedial striatum and hippocampus are weakened while the representations in dorsolateral striatum, thalamus, cerebellum and secondary motor cortex are strengthened.

To conclude, our results show that among the regions dynamically recruited by practice of a sequential motor skill, only part of those show plasticity of local neuronal circuits to encode and process the specific sequential information, and that some of these representations prevail at different time during learning.
Additionally, these results show the possibility to investigate memory-specific representational changes appearing in an earlier phase of learning, notably by measuring adapted multivariate representational distances and applying non-parametric statistical testing.
Therefore, we think that Elife readers would be interested in these results that specify the functional roles of the regions involved in sequential motor skills, as well as in the methodological approaches to measure representational plasticity.

I remain at your disposal for any further information.
