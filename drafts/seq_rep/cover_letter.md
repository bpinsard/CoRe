Please find attached the manuscript "<place final title here>" by Pinsard, Boutin, Gabitov, Benali and Doyon, for consideration as a research article in Elife neuroscience category.

This article investigate the reorganization of the networks supporting the expression of newly acquired sequential skills after their consolidation using novel multivariate measures of fMRI BOLD activity patterns.

Research in neuroimaging, including work in our lab, have largely described non-linear evolution of brain activity levels along the course of motor sequence learning, and notably the reorganization of a network comprising cortical, cerebellar hippocampal and striatal regions that is observed when initial practice and retest sessions are separated by a sleep period.
While these changes reflect that complementary processes contributing to a more efficient practice are recruited differentially in the course of learning, these does not necessarily reflect that all these regions encode the motor sequential knowledge in local neuronal circuit which have been shown to be measurable by fine-grained activity patterns of BOLD activity.

Indeed, while previous research have investigated the representation of sequences, the sequence were either intensively trained over multiple days or newly practiced, the pattern evaluation was limited to dorsal cortical surface, and multivariate approach was based on classifiers performance with parametric statistical testing which can suffer from bias.

We here wanted to investigate representational changes at a more focused and earlier stage of motor sequence learning that is the consolidation following regular practice.
By measuring patterns of activity evoked by the practice of two explicitely trained sequences of finger movements which underwent consolidation, as well as two similar newly acquired sequences, we were able to compute the unbiased multivariate distance between the patterns over the whole brain.
We assess the prevalence of significant multivariate distances and their differences between learning stages across participants using non-parametric permutation testing.

We uncover that large cortical regions representing new and consolidated sequences overlap, while there is a significant consolidation-induced reorganization of subcortical networks, showing that encoding of sequence in dorsomedial and dorsolateral striatal network are respectively weakened and strengthened.


To conclude our results

These results also shows that it is possible to investigate knowledge-related representational changes that occur in an earlier phase of learning.
As we discovered striatal and hippocampal representations, further work is required to precisely investigate what is the geometry of this representation, notably whether respective egocentric and allocentric encoding can be measured.

For these reasons we think that Elife readers would be interested in those results.

I remain at your disposal for any further information.
