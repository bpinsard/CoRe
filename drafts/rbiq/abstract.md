Motor skills recruits an extended network of cerebral and spinal regions, which involvement evolves differently across learning stages [@dayan_neuroplasticity_2011]. Motor sequence learning causes a subset of this network to specialize for a specific learned sequence leading to performance improvement and long term consolidation. We here aim at finding the regions encoding sequence-specific representation accross the brain after sleep-related consolidation.

#### Methods
Subjects had to repeatedly perform 5 repetitions of 4 different sequences presented in a custom order on the screen (eg 1-4-2-3-1) in a rapid block design using a ergonomic response pad while BOLD fMRI scan being acquired.
Preprocessed data was analysed for multivariate patterns (MVPA)
